Simper - A blog content engine thing done simply so you can
         simper on the internet too!

== Needs

=== From python

* selector
* kid
* sqlalchemy 
* clearfilter (for clear template separation)
* closet (found near the simper svn)

=== Otherwise

* a browser
* sqlite3

== To Make it Go:

# Start up your getter, putter, and poster from closet:

    (in your closet directory, don't forget to mkdir storage)
    python manage.py run getter
    python manage.py run putter
    python manage.py run poster

# Get your database going:

    (in your simper directory)
    python manage drop
    python manage create
    python manage fill

# Start up simper:

    (in your simper directory)
    python manage run

# Go have a look with your browser:

    http://0.0.0.0:8080/content

  You should get a clickable list of 3 "pages", with their modified
  times, and revision count.
  
# add some content

    python ink.py "<some title>" < <some conent on STDIN>

  You _can_ add additional revisions to existing titles.

== Notes

* No particular reason to use kid and sqlalchemy, just what 
  I happened to have around.
* Closet could certainly have a nicer startup.
* Read the manage code to see the options for saving the database away to the
  closet for later bootstrapping.
