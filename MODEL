= How's it fit together.

Simper is the overarching name of the tool. It is a content
repository that might be a blog or a wiki, or both. It consists
of pages (content) that have names, and revisions that are associated 
with those names. Any individual name can have many revisions and
any revisions can be the content of many names.

A revision contains no content itself, but keeps content in a 
closet, accessed in simper via the butler module.

manage.py can create (see README) the two necessary database
tables: content and revision.

publisher.py provides a read view onto the content via a controller,
called producer.py. 

editor.py is an editing oriented view (not yet done) that uses ink.py
to get to the model.

ink.py can be used as a command line editor when run (see README).

So things look a bit like this:


      +----------------------+---------------------+
      |    publisher         |    editor           |
      +----------------------+---------------------+
      |    producer          |    ink              |
      +----------------------+---------------------+
      |               model and closet             |
      +--------------------------------------------+

At the moment access to the closet is a bit confused.

The publisher uses lead.py to turn creole text into
HTML.
